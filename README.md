# Java LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to the Java LeetCode Solutions repository! This project is organized to provide multiple possible solutions for various LeetCode problems, with a focus on Java implementations.

## Project Structure

- **Solutions Directory**: Each LeetCode problem is contained within its own directory, named according to the problem's title in a lowercase, hyphen-separated format (e.g., `two-sum`, `smallest-difference-pair`). Each directory may contain multiple Java files, each representing a different solution approach.

## Usage

To explore a solution for a specific LeetCode problem, navigate to the respective directory and examine the available Java files. Each file will contain a distinct approach to solving the problem, showcasing different algorithms or techniques.

### Example

For example, to view solutions for the "Two Sum" problem, you would navigate to:

```
two-sum/
```

Here, you will find multiple Java files, each offering a different way to tackle the problem.
